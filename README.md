- 👋 Hi, I’m @K43LS
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more for programming in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mobile Development and I'm studying Computer Engineering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with very patient people since I'm a bit slow to understand but I like to learn new things
- 📫 This is my email for contact: kael7.2012@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Sometimes I have no idea what I'm doing but I still try to learn new things
